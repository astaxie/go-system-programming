Go system programming
=====================

Go System Programming is a book about how to do Linux System Programming in Go. There are many books introducing the basic of Go. Like:

- [Go tutorial](http://tour.golang.org/)
- [Learning Go](http://archive.miek.nl/projects/learninggo/index.html)
- [Build web application with golang](http://astaxie.gitbooks.io/build-web-application-with-golang/content/)
- [Learn Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/)

But I found there are no books introduce Go System Programming these years. Actually Go is the best system language in 21th Century. There are so many systems developed by Go, like `Docker`, `etcd`, `consul` etc. It's all related with system programming. But if we want to develop an application related with Linux. There are rarely materials about how to use Go to accomplish that. Like `Linux IO`, `Socket`, `mmap`, `Lock`, `Thread`, `Process` etc. So I want to write this book to introduce Linux System Programming. I will write this book in Chinese. Then it will translated  to other languages.
